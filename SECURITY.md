### Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open GitHub issues or pull requests - this makes the problem immediately visible to everyone, including malicious actors.   

Security issues in this open source project can be safely reported to Creations's [Vulnerability Disclosure and Reward Program](https://creations.global/docs/security/creations#disclosure-and-reward-program).
Creations's security team will triage your report and respond according to its impact on Creations users and systems.
